yet another track art viewer

I'm currently using CMUS a lot. I wanted something to display the images.
This was supposed to be a simple shell script and it quickly got out of hand, send help.

This has minimal testing.

## Features
- it sure handles images
- hey, technically it works under wayland!
- crashes when a song doesn't have an id3v2 tag
- only handles .mp3s
  - .ogg & .flacs also work probably.
- it has under 100 lines of code (and many, many gigantic packages imported).
